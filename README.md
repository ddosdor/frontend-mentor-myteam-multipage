# Frontend Mentor - myteam website solution

Since one of my goals for this year (2021) is to improve my skills with Figma and TailwindCSS I took a "workshop" on one of the chalenges from Frontend Mentor.

This is a solution to the [myteam website challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/myteam-multipage-website-mxlEauvW).

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- See the correct content for each team member on the About page when the `+` icon is clicked
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Message` fields are empty should show "This field is required"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
